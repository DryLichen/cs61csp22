********************    EXERCISE 1    **********************

Scenario 1:
1. What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe? Write your answer 
in the form “[parameter A], [parameter B]” where [parameter A] and [parameter B] complete 
the following response: "Because [parameter A] in bytes is exactly equal to [parameter B] 
in bytes." Note: Don't forget that 'cache size' is a valid parameter that you implicitly 
set by choosing the block size and the # of blocks.
    
    A: step size     B: block size

2. What is the hit rate if we increase Rep Count arbitrarily? Write your answer as a 
decimal (e.g. "1.0" if the HR is 100%).

    0.0. Step size is still equals to block size.

3. How could we modify one program parameter to get an increased hit rate?
Write your answer in the form “[parameter], [value]” where [parameter] is the program 
parameter you want to change and [value] is the value you want to change it to. 
Note: We don't care if we access the same array elements. Just give us a program parameter 
modification that would increase the hit rate. However, do make sure that your proposed value
is valid.

    parameter: a1    value: 1.0

Scenario 2:
1. How many memory accesses are there per iteration of the inner loop (not the one involving Rep Count)?

    64

2. What is the repeating hit/miss pattern? 
Write your answer in the form "mmhhmh" and so on, where your response is the shortest pattern that gets repeated.

    mhhh

3. Keeping everything else the same, what does our hit rate approach as Rep Count goes to infinity? 
Try it out by changing the appropriate program parameter and letting the code run! Write your answer as a decimal.

    1.0

Scenario 3:
1. What is the hit rate of the L1 cache? The L2 cache? Overall? Each hit rate is a decimal rounded to two places.

    0.50   0.00   0.50  

2. How many accesses do we have to the L1 cache total? How many of them are misses?

    32    16

3. How many accesses do we have to the L2 cache total? 
HINT: Think about what the L1 cache has to do in order to make us access the L2 cache.

    16

4. What program parameter would allow us to increase the L2 hit rate, but keep the L1 hit rate the same?

    Rep Count. If it is 2, L2 hit rate will chanege to 0.50

5. Do our L1 and L2 hit rates decrease (-), stay the same (=), or increase (+) as we 
(1) increase the number of blocks in L1, or (2) increase the L1 block size?

    (1) L1 = ; L2 =
    (2) L1 + ; L2 =

    kji:    n = 1000, 4.458 Gflop/s
    

2. Which 2 orderings perform the worst?

    kij:    n = 1000, 0.115 Gflop/s
